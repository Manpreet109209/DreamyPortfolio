✨ Overview

This project is my personal developer portfolio, designed as an interactive desktop-like interface rather than a traditional static website.
It focuses on component-driven architecture, clean UI systems, and intentional motion, not visual noise.

Every window, interaction, and animation is built to behave like a real system, not a demo.

🔧 Key Features

OS-style window system with consistent open/close behavior

Icon-based navigation with contextual popups

Data-driven Projects and Links architecture

Smooth, motion-safe animations with prefers-reduced-motion support

Responsive layout designed for both desktop and mobile

Clean separation of logic, styling, and content

PNG-based layered backgrounds for performance and control

🛠 Tech Stack

React

JavaScript (ES6+)

Modern CSS (flexbox, clamp, transitions)

🎯 Why This Project

Most student portfolios are either copied templates or broken demos.
This project was built from scratch to demonstrate:

Real UI system thinking

Scalable component design

Attention to interaction details

Production-level frontend practices

This is not just a portfolio. It’s a designed interface.

🚀 Status

Actively improving and refining.
Architecture-first. Visual polish second.
